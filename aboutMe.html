            <h2>Looking Forward...</h2>
            <small>Summer 2024</small>
            <p class="aboutp">As I continue to get more confident in my coding abilities and expand my portfolio I look forward to
                gaining real-world industry experience outside the classroom.  I am actively seeking internships in
                Software Development across the United States, where I am confident that I can make valuable
                contributions and a meaningful impact. I am enthusiastic about the prospect of contributing to the
                software industry's growth and advancement.</p>

                 <h2>Began my Master's in Software Development</h2>
                 <small>August, 2023 - Present</small>
                 <p class="aboutp">In August 2023 I began my 16-month MSD program. The program was specifically designed for people
                    who did not have a background in Computer Science, and is expedited to produce fully competent
                    software engineers in less than a year and a half. This has been by far the most challenging thing
                    I have ever done, but that's what I was looking for when I left Hospitality. I am grateful to have
                    found this career, and I am excited to continue to be able to push myself every day as I keep up with
                    a quickly changing and growing industry.</p>

                <h2>Traveled to South America</h2>
                <small>April, 2023</small>
                <p class="aboutp">At the end of my time at the Montage Resort I went on a three-week trip to South America. My property 
                    had been newly opened and because of this, had hired nearly all of their frontline staff
                    from an international work and travel program. My whole team for the two F&B outlets I managed were
                    from Argentina and Brazil. After sharing time with them in the USA and getting to share pieces of
                    our culture with them (South Americans do NOT like rootbeer floats) I went down to visit them to
                    appreciate their culture. Getting to travel internationally opened up my eyes to what I wanted to
                    see and do in my life, and it was while I was in Brazil that I got accepted to the Master's program
                    that I am currently enrolled in.</p>

                <h2>Worked in Hospitality but Needed a Change</h2>
                <small>May 2021 - April, 2023</small>
                <p class="aboutp">My 2 years working for Marriott were full of experiences I will always be grateful for. I met people
                    from all walks of life, made friends for life, but most importantly, gained clarity about my career
                    path. Having accelerated through high school and college to enter the workforce early, I had
                    envisioned continuous growth and fulfillment in Hospitality. However, as I delved deeper into
                    roles spanning the Front Desk, Housekeeping, and Food and Beverage departments, I began to feel a
                    sense of monotony. I hungered for challenges that would push me to excel and opportunities to learn
                    something new each day. It was while I was a Food and Beverage Manager at a Montage Resort that
                    I discovered the University of Utah's Master of Software Development program and decided to apply.</p>

                <small>January, 2019 - May, 2021</small>
                <p class="aboutp">After graduating from high school I moved to Utah to continue my education at Utah Valley University.
                    In 2021, I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science Degree in Hospitality Management. I graduated
                    Summa Cum Laude and was awarded the "Outstanding Student" award of my graduating class. I had been
                    working at a Marriott Vacation Club resort in Park City while completing my degree and within a week
                    of my graduation I had moved to Palm Springs, California, to continue my career with the company.</p>

                    brothers. I am grateful to have grown up in the PNW and always look forward to returning home to
                    visit friends and family.</p>
