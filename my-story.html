                internships in Software Development across the United States,
                where I am confident that I can make valuable contributions and
                a meaningful impact. I am enthusiastic about the prospect of

                In August 2023 I began my 16-month MSD program. The program was
                specifically designed for people who did not have a background
                in Computer Science, and is expedited to produce fully competent
                software engineers in less than a year and a half. This has been
                by far the most challenging thing I have ever done, but that's
                what I was looking for when I left Hospitality. I am grateful to
                have found this career, and I am excited to continue to be able
                to push myself every day as I keep up with a quickly changing
                and growing industry.

                At the end of my time at the Montage Resort I went on a
                three-week trip to South America. My property had been newly
                opened and because of this, had hired nearly all of their
                frontline staff from an international work and travel program.
                My whole team for the two F&amp;B outlets I managed were from
                Argentina and Brazil. After sharing time with them in the USA
                and getting to share pieces of our culture with them (South
                Americans do NOT like rootbeer floats) I went down to visit them
                to appreciate their culture. Getting to travel internationally
                opened up my eyes to what I wanted to see and do in my life, and
                it was while I was in Brazil that I got accepted to the Master's
                program that I am currently enrolled in.

                Worked in Hospitality but Needed a Change

                My 2 years working for Marriott were full of experiences I will
                always be grateful for. I met people from all walks of life,
                made friends for life, but most importantly, gained clarity
                about my career path. Having accelerated through high school and
                college to enter the workforce early, I had envisioned
                continuous growth and fulfillment in Hospitality. However, as I
                delved deeper into roles spanning the Front Desk, Housekeeping,
                and Food and Beverage departments, I began to feel a sense of
                monotony. I hungered for challenges that would push me to excel
                and opportunities to learn something new each day. It was while
                I was a Food and Beverage Manager at a Montage Resort that I
                discovered the University of Utah's Master of Software
                Development program and decided to apply.

              <span class="my-story-text17">
                After graduating from high school I moved to Utah to continue my
                education at Utah Valley University. In 2021, I graduated with a
                Bachelor's of Science Degree in Hospitality Management. I
                graduated Summa Cum Laude and was awarded the "Outstanding
                Student" award of my graduating class. I had been working at a
                Marriott Vacation Club resort in Park City while completing my
                degree and within a week of my graduation I had moved to Palm
                Springs, California, to continue my career with the company.

                I grew up in Seattle, Washington and attended Issaquah High
                School, class of 2019. While in my formative years I developed a
                love for reading, soccer, baking, and spending time with my four
                brothers. I am grateful to have grown up in the PNW and always
                look forward to returning home to visit friends and family.
