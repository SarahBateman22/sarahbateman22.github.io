                When the Covid lockdown began in March 2020, I found myself with
                a lot of free time on my hands. My dad and I turned to reading
                as a means to enrich this period, exchanging recommendations of
                our favorite books. This tradition evolved, and now every
                December, I compile a list of 12 books for us to read throughout
                the following year. Reading is something I am really passionate
                about, so please feel free to "join" our bookclub and read along
                with us! I also have a list of

                  Sarah: 2.5/5. There were a couple moments that made me laugh
                  and I can see how it could translate to a funny movie. Some of
                  the word play and silly characters reminded me of "The Phantom
                  Tollbooth" which is a GREAT book (that my dad also doesn't
                  like). Overall, though, it was pretty "meh" for me.

                  As soon as I started reading the story came flooding back to

                  love how well the author explains both sides of the story
                  (Ross and the FBI). I would switch who I was rooting for every
                  chapter, it was genuinely incredible story-telling. This is my
                  most-recommended book of all time and I've probably loaned out

                  Sarah: 4.5/5. Andy Weir also wrote The Martian which is one of
                  my favorite books of all time. I felt like this book had a
                  similar vibe, but was more physics-based while The Martian is
                  biology-based. Some really interesting ideas were thrown
                  around in this book (purposefully causing global warming
                  because the Sun is dying??) and I love the sense of humor the
                  main character has.

                  . The Martian is one of my all-time favorite books. I kept my
                  expectations low for Project Hail Mary (and Artemis) for fear
                  of disappointment. Project Hail Mary is a solid Sci-Fi novel.
                  It’s no “The Martian”, but it’s better than Artemis (which is
                  also an adequate read).

                  of different ways, it's so funny to me that his vice was
                  breaking into companies software just for the fun of it. It's
                  cool that he made a career out of hacking after getting out of

                  4/5. Kevin Mitnik (RIP) was just a few years older than me, so
                  I could relate to the time period technology and appreciate
                  what he was able to accomplish. Addiction comes in many forms,
                  and he certainly had his that he couldn’t give up even at risk

                  Sarah: 5/5! This the funniest book I've read in a long time.
                  It's supposed to read like a video game and I think it does
                  that and more - you lose track of time and can't put it down
                  like a video game! This is a relatively new book, but I can
                  see it becoming a cult classic.

                  4/5. Hilarious. If you like Shaun of the Dead, this book is
                  for you.
