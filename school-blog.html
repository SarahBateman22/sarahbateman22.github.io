              >This week I was still ahead of schedule with school, so I spent a
              lot of time researching what path in software engineering I want
              to start focusing on. As of this week I am feeling the most drawn
              to cyber security. I reached out to an alumni from my program to
              get his advice on how to get into the industry and he gave me some
              great advice, including referring me to some certificate programs
              like OSCP, Security+, and CISSP. I've started doing some modules
              on TryHackMe as well which have been super engaging.&nbsp;</span
            ><br /><br /><span
              >One thing that the alumni mentioned that I thought was really
              interesting was that a lot of employers will look for capture the
              flag accomplishments (like what is on TryHackMe) on resumes, but
              those actually aren't a good representation of what's happening in
              the real world. He recommended some newsletters that report on
              current hacks and bugs, how they were discovered, and what was
              done to resolve them.&nbsp;</span
            ><br /><br /><span
              >I also signed up to attend a cyber security conference in Salt
              Lake City next week. It's a two-day event with speaks and
              workshops; I'm hoping to do a lot of networking while I'm there.
              One speaker in particular is in a slack group I'm in for women in
              SLC that are in software engineering, she will be speaking on the
              transition from software development to cyber security. I'm really
              looking forward to attending the event!</span

              >I was working at my job a lot this week, but luckily I was ahead
              of schedule for school because of everything I did last week. I
              mainly worked on the thread-safe queue assignment for my Operating
              Systems class. This was a pretty short assignment - I implemented
              a serial queue (backed by a linked list) and then just added locks
              to it to make it thread-safe. Locks were placed around anything
              that could cause a potential race condition (data that multiple
              threads are trying to access and change). I had to lock most of
              the enqueue and dequeue methods because changing the head and tail
              pointers could be a race condition. I also had to lock the
              variable that keeps track of the size of the list.&nbsp;</span
            ><br /><br /><span
              >In Software Engineering II we added smart pointers to our script
              project. Smart pointers are template classes in C++ that
              automatically deallocate memory when it's no longer needed. When a
              smart pointer goes out of scope it's destructor is automatically
              called. This was a crucial part of the project as it eliminated
              any data leaks that were occurring. After adding the smart pointer
              header file that declared the new pointers, I used AI to go
              through my project and replace my old pointers with smart
              pointers.</span

              >This was a busy week. My primary focus was on a project for my
              Networks and Security class, centering on Transport Layer Security
              (TLS). Through this, I gained a much better understanding of
              Diffie-Hellman key generation and cipher block chaining.
              Additionally, we conducted a lab where we utilized a buffer
              overflow vulnerability to bypass a password-protected program. Due
              to a coding error, input beyond the intended password length was
              processed, allowing for manipulation of the login verification by
              inserting "junk" data up to the point where the success address on
              the stack could be altered.</span
            ><br /><br /><span
              >In my Operating Systems class, we starting talking about thread
              synchronization using locks, transitioning from managing code
              safety in Java through synchronized sections to applying these
              concepts in C++. Our upcoming project asks us to develop a
              thread-safe queue in C++, contrasting its performance and safety
              with a standard queue, to solidify our understanding of locking
              mechanisms in managing concurrent processes.</span
            ><br /><br /><span
              >For my Software Engineering II class, we did a quick lab on
              profiling code to optimize performance, as well as completing
              another assignment for MSDscript where I implemented function
              calls. This allows my program to be able to parse and evaluate
              function like "_let f = _fun (x) x+1 _in f(10)" which would
              compute to 11.&nbsp;</span

              >My main focus this week was in Operating Systems; my assignment
              was to create an alternative to the malloc() function in C++,
              using only mmap (and munmap for deallocation). I designed a system
              backed by a custom hashmap to track allocated memory addresses and
              sizes. Upon a call to my malloc replacement, it calculates the
              minimal pages required for the requested memory, finds an
              appropriate slot in the hashmap, and logs the allocation details,
              ensuring efficient and organized memory management.</span

              >In Networks and Security I had a checkpoint due for a larger
              assignment due in two weeks. I generated a bunch of secure keys in
              the terminal, then explained briefly how each one would be used
              during runtime when I finish my Transport Layer Security
              implementation.&nbsp;</span

              >Software Engineering II was heavily project-based this week. I
              updated my program to work with conditional statements
              like&nbsp;_if _true _then 4 _else 5, which by itself would simply
              evaluate to 4, however this update can also be used in _let
              statements which was pretty tricky to get working. Updating my
              parsing script was the hardest part of this assignment for me,
              though. Having to switch through _if, _else, and _then took a lot
              of new calls.&nbsp;</span

            ><span>Midterm week. Wahoo.</span><br /><br /><span
              >Studying for Software Engineering II wasn't too bad. I've been
              familiar with most of the topics (debugging, code coverage,
              exhaustive testing, etc.) for a while now. I ended up getting a
              96% on the test.</span
            ><br /><br /><span
              >Studying for Networks and Security, on the other hand, was quite
              the feat. My friend Corinne and I were on campus until midnight
              the night before the test quizzing each other on the topics. I
              feel really good about IP configuration, machine states, and
              congestion control. I also finally feel better about block cipher
              modes of operation. I feel like I generally get the idea of
              Diffie-Hellman but how to actually implement it is not quite
              clicking for me yet. The other thing I'm worried about on the test
              is just how many key terms we've been exposed to so far this
              semester. The test ended up being harder than the professor
              intended, none of us finished it (or really got close). He put the
              final grades on a pretty generous curve, I got a 96% again.</span

              >This week I had a lot of work to do for Software Engineering II
              and Networks and Security. In Software Engineering, I added
              parsing to my MSDscript project. Right now we have Add,
              Multiplication, Variable, and Let (keyword) expressions. To
              actually be able to use them in the terminal, though, we need to
              tell the program how to read whatever the user inputs. This
              sounded easier to me than it actually was. I had to take into
              account parentheses, extra spaces, distinguishing between
              variables and actual keywords, and more. It ended up being a LOT
              of checking for certain conditions and passing to appropriate
              methods to handle that condition.&nbsp;</span

              >In Networks and Security we have a cryptography assignment due
              next week that I wanted to get out of the way this week so I can
              spend next week studying for midterms. First I had to make a block
              cipher, then the second part was making an RC4 cipher. This wasn't
              too bad of an assignment for me, however I still don't feel
              confident on the modes of operation that block ciphers can be used
              in. I think that's going to be on the midterm, so I'll spend some
              time studying it next week.&nbsp;</span
